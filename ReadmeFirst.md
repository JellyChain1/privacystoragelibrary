## Step-by-Step Guide: Working with the Privacy Storage Library

### 1. Integration

#### Installation

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the Privacy Storage Library repository to your local machine.
2. **Solidity Integration:** Copy the `PrivacyStorageLibrary.sol` file into your Solidity project directory.

### 2. Usage

#### Initializing the Library

1. **Library Instance:** Declare an instance of `PrivacyStorageLibrary.PrivacyStorage` in your Solidity contract.
   ```solidity
   using PrivacyStorageLibrary for PrivacyStorageLibrary.PrivacyStorage;
   PrivacyStorageLibrary.PrivacyStorage private privacyStorage;
   ```

#### Storing Data

1. **Store Data:** Use the `storeDataWithSalt` function to store data with a custom salt.
   ```solidity
   bytes memory data = "Your data here";
   bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Your custom salt"));
   privacyStorage.storeDataWithSalt(data, salt);
   ```

#### Retrieving Data

1. **Retrieve Data:** Retrieve data associated with your address and custom salt using `retrieveDataWithSalt`.
   ```solidity
   bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Your custom salt"));
   bytes memory retrievedData = privacyStorage.retrieveDataWithSalt(msg.sender, salt);
   ```

#### Getting Data Hashes

1. **Retrieve Hashes:** Get an array of data hashes associated with your address and custom salt.
   ```solidity
   bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Your custom salt"));
   bytes32[] memory hashes = privacyStorage.getUserDataHashesWithSalt(msg.sender, salt);
   ```

### 3. Contribution

#### Contributing to the Library

1. **Fork Repository:** Fork the Privacy Storage Library repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Make Changes:** Make necessary changes or improvements to the library codebase.
3. **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes to your forked repository and push them.
4. **Create Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to the main repository, detailing the changes made and their purpose.

### Conclusion

Working with the Privacy Storage Library involves integrating it into your Solidity projects, utilizing its functions to store and retrieve data with custom salts. Additionally, contributing to the library is encouraged by forking the repository, making improvements, and submitting pull requests to the main repository.

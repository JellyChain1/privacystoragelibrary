# Privacy Storage Library

## Overview

This Solidity library, `PrivacyStorageLibrary`, provides a secure means of storing and retrieving data while ensuring privacy using custom salts. It's designed to maintain data integrity through a Merkle tree root and allows users to associate data hashes with their addresses and custom salts.

## Purpose

The library is developed to address the following key objectives:

- **Privacy:** Enable users to store and retrieve data in a manner that's resistant to precomputed hash attacks by utilizing custom salts.
- **Data Integrity:** Maintain the integrity of stored data using a Merkle tree root to ensure tamper resistance.
- **Customization:** Allow users to associate their data with unique custom salts for added security.

## Components

### PrivacyStorage Struct

The core structure within the library is `PrivacyStorage`, which contains:

- `root`: A Merkle tree root used to maintain data integrity.
- `userDataByHash`: A mapping that associates user addresses and data hashes with the actual data.
- `userSaltHashes`: A mapping to link user addresses and salts with corresponding data hashes.

### Functions

The library provides three key functions:

- `storeDataWithSalt`: Stores data provided by users along with a custom salt. It calculates the hash of the data combined with the salt, updates the Merkle tree root, and associates the data hash with the user and salt.
- `retrieveDataWithSalt`: Allows users to retrieve their data associated with a specific address and salt. This function ensures that only the authorized user can access the data.
- `getUserDataHashesWithSalt`: Provides users with a list of data hashes associated with their address and a specific salt. This function is used to retrieve all data hashes linked to a particular user and salt combination.

### Events

The library emits an event `DataStored` whenever data is successfully stored using `storeDataWithSalt`.

## Security Considerations

- **Custom Salts:** The use of custom salts significantly enhances security by making it harder for attackers to reverse-engineer hashes and access data.
- **Data Integrity:** The Merkle tree root ensures that any tampering with stored data can be easily identified.
- **Access Control:** Functions like `retrieveDataWithSalt` enforce access control, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve their data.

## Usage

To utilize this library, the following steps can be followed:

1. **Import the Library:**
   Import `PrivacyStorageLibrary.sol` into your Solidity contract:

   ```solidity
   import "PrivacyStorageLibrary.sol";
   ```

2. **Create an Instance:**
   Create an instance of `PrivacyStorage` in your contract:

   ```solidity
   using PrivacyStorageLibrary for PrivacyStorageLibrary.PrivacyStorage;
   PrivacyStorageLibrary.PrivacyStorage private privacyStorage;
   ```

3. **Use Library Functions:**
   Utilize functions like `storeDataWithSalt`, `retrieveDataWithSalt`, and `getUserDataHashesWithSalt` as required in your contract logic.

## Auditing and Security

For auditing purposes and security preparation, it's essential to:

- **Test Scenarios:** Create test cases to cover various scenarios for storing and retrieving data with different salts.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases, such as empty data, nonexistent data hashes, or unauthorized access, and ensure the contract behaves as expected.
- **Gas Optimization:** Evaluate gas costs associated with storing and retrieving data, especially when dealing with larger data sizes or a high number of stored hashes.
